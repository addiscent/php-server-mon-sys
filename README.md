# php-server-mon-sys
Installs a turnkey "PHP Server Monitor" system; PHP-Server-Mon, NGINX, MySQL, PHP-FPM.  Deployed using Docker containers.  That's the plan, anyway...

Not yet intended for public consumption, this is a checkpoint push of a very crude prototype, (for all practical purposes, just an offsite backup).
